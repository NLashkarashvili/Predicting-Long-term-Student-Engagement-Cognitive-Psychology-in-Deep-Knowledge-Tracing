<h1> Predicting Student "Spacing" </h1>
 
 <h2> Problem Statement </h2>
 Predict the number of sessions a student will practice/study in the next 30 days based on his/her previous interactions and performance. 
  
 <h2> The Repository </h2> 
  This repository includes implementation of two models for the problem, an LSTM-based model, where the final dense layer leverages concatenation of LSTM outputs, and a transformer-based architecture with stacked encoders, composed of self-attention layers and feed-forward networks. The models were trained on EdNet[1] dataset.
